# üõçÔ∏è Product Search API ‚Äî Spring Boot (Java 21)

A **Spring Boot** application built with **Java 21**, **Gradle**, and an **H2 in-memory database**.  
This project provides REST APIs to **generate**, **list**, and **search** products.  
The search endpoint performs **backend filtering** against multiple fields ‚Äî `name`, `description`, `brand`, `category`, and `sku`.

Assumptions

‚ÄúDynamic filter‚Äù = single free-text query matched across name, description, category, brand, SKU; numeric tokens match price/stock exactly.

Pagination + sort are required for snappy UX with 100‚Äì1000 rows.

Performance choices

H2 with indices on search columns for LIKE scans; paging limits to ‚â§100 items.

Batched inserts enabled to generate up to 1k quickly.

Improvements with more time

Multi-facet filters (price range, category list, stock > 0), fuzzy match, and highlighting.

Full-text via PostgreSQL GIN/tsvector or Elasticsearch/OpenSearch if scale grows.

Caching hot queries, rate-limiting, metrics, and tracing.

Contract tests + controller slice tests + testcontainers against Postgres.
